About:

This repository mainly has files pertaining to an ASCII art project that I completed at MIT HSSP. To see the ASCII art, open the files "Dustin Pedroia.txt" and "Mike Napoli.txt" and zoom out of those files until you see the picture. The picture should look just like "Dustin Pedroia.jpg" and "Mike Napoli.jpg" respectively.
